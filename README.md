# Debreif
A personal video journaling app that allows user to track progress. Used for therapists and patients


Inspiration The idea for Debrief came from the team's personal experiences with journaling and the desire to create a more efficient and convenient way to document one's thoughts, feelings and daily experiences. We realized that a video journaling app would be an innovative solution to traditional text-based journaling and we wanted to make it accessible for people who find traditional journaling to be time-consuming or difficult.

What it does Debrief is a video journaling app that allows users to record short clips of their thoughts and feelings on a daily basis using python GUI. These clips are then stored in a personal journal, where they can be re-watched and reflected on. The app also includes features such as mood tracking and the ability to tag and search for specific entries, which are built using python.

How we built it We built Debrief using Python and its GUI library Tkinter for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. The app uses the device's camera and microphone to record videos, which are then stored in Firebase's cloud storage. We also implemented Firebase's authentication and real-time database features to handle user accounts and journal entries.

Challenges we ran into One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring that the video recording and storage process was seamless and efficient using python. We also had to overcome some technical difficulties when implementing the mood tracking and tagging features.

Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of the simplicity and user-friendliness of Debrief's interface that was achieved using python gui. We believe that it makes the journaling process more accessible and enjoyable for users. We also received positive feedback from beta testers on the efficiency and convenience of the video journaling format.

What we learned Through this project, we learned the importance of user-centered design and testing. We also gained experience with Python, Tkinter and Firebase, which we believe will be useful in future projects.

What's next for Debrief We plan to continue improving Debrief by adding new features such as video editing tools and the ability to share journal entries with friends. We also aim to make the app available on other platforms such as iOS and the web, using python and its GUI library Tkinter.
